<h3> WE ARE TRULY NATURAL </h3><hr>
<center>
<p> At MRP's Farm, we strive hard to ensure that the milk you receive from us is as close to nature as it is intended to be. 
Our milk is 100% pure - Nothing is ever added or removed from our milk and it is also truly natural - free from antibiotics, hormones and other harmful adulterants.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:5%"> WE BELIEVE YOU DESERVE THE BEST</h2><hr>
<p>At MRP'sFarm, we take the quality of our milk very seriously. We TEST our milk every single day to ensure that you receive only the best quality milk.

We started with 20 cows in Oct 2015 at Ludhiana. We have been steadily increasing our herd of cows and buffaloes to increase our milk production. In addition to
 our own farm, MRP's Farm works with small Co-operatives of farmers around us who produce great milk for us.

Every batch of milk is tested for several parameters- adulterants, antibiotics, hormones and also taste and smell. We do an average of 400-500 tests daily on our milk 
just to ensure you receive the best quality milk. Our tested milk is then pasteurized and chilled and delivered to you right the very next day so it's freshness is intact.
